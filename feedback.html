                Giving feedback can be difficult to do for many people. Some may not know what to say, are afraid of hurting someone’s feelings, or actually end up making the receiver of the feedback feel bad. I think the tips about giving feedback that were given in this article were very helpful. 
                </p>

                <p>There are two types of feedback that work really well in teams. The first is called “reinforcing feedback,” which you use when you want someone to keep doing something. An example of this is saying something like, “I really admire your dedication to finding new activity ideas. By being actively involved and proactive, we are able to produce better volunteering programs.” </p>
                
                <p>The other type of feedback is “redirecting feedback.” This is used when you identify a behavior that someone needs to change. You can tell someone to stop doing X and start doing Y. An example of this is, “Instead of coming to officer meetings virtually, I’d love for you to start coming in person so we can communicate and collaborate easier as a team. Would that be possible?” </p>
                
                <p>The article also mentions that overall, some tips for giving good feedback are: only sharing one piece of feedback at a time, directing your feedback to the design, not the designer, highlighting real examples of the behavior (whether good or bad), giving the feedback as soon as possible, and giving feedback regularly will lead your team to success. </p>
