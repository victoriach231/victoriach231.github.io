                In this Color Harmony reading, the author describes how each color can relate to many human emotions, experiences, and symbols. These associations are natural to us, learned through everyday life experiences. In the book, red is described as “a heart full of love,” “sexy and passionate,” and “seduction and sensuality” (Eiseman 29). Gray is described as “solid and everlasting,” and “seriousness and strength” (Eiseman 49). In Taylor Swift’s song, “Red,” she makes use of color symbolism in her lyrics. The meaning behind her lyrics is easy to interpret because we can understand the emotions behind the colors chosen. The line: “but loving him was red” relates to the passionate, fierce love she had for her boyfriend when their relationship was strong. “Losing him was blue like I’d never known” is another line in her song. Blue is often associated with sadness, so we can recognize that the relationship wasn’t going as well. “Missing him was dark gray, all alone” could represent how the good parts of the relationship were hard to forget, the sadness lasted for a while. From this, we see that using color can easily help create imagery and emotions in others. Taylor Swift is one of my favorite artists, so it is cool to be able to connect concepts to one of her songs.             </p>
